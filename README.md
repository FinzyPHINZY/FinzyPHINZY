🌎 A big part of everyday involves working on a project or a fun code challenge. Don't be surprised when you find out I'm constantly reading books or asking a lot of questions. 

📖 I'm reading "The Clean Coder - A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers" by Robert C. Martin.

🎏 I love linux, chess and projects. I’m open to collaborate on Projects with other developers.
