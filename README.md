# 👋 Hey, I'm Boluwatife

I build things that work. Frontend? Backend? I’m *in*.  
They say you can’t be great at both frontend and backend. I say, hold my terminal.

### 🚀 Who Am I?
I’m a full-stack developer who genuinely loves software — not just the shiny parts, but the ugly bugs, the confusing docs, and the edge cases that don’t make sense until 3 days (and 20 tabs) later.

- I **love software** — not just building cool things, but figuring out the messy, hard, “why-is-this-even-breaking” stuff.
- I dive into things I suck at, break them down, and master them. Curiosity + persistence = my thing.
- I take on projects I don’t yet understand, **phase them out**, and **ship clean, working solutions**.
- Used **Google Pub/Sub**, **Cloud Storage**, and **Vertex AI** on the deepfake project — learned as I built.
- Yes, I write **documentation**. No, I don’t hate it.

### 📦 Some Stuff I've Built

- 💸 **Bold Data** – A fintech engine with PalmPay virtual accounts, smart webhooks, transaction analytics, and daily traffic that keeps me humble.

- 🔍 **Deepfake Detector** – GCP-powered media validation pipeline using Pub/Sub, Vertex AI, and Cloud Storage. Took it from “how do I even start this?” to “heck yeah, it works.”

🕵️‍♂️ Psst... I’ve got more cool stuff hiding in my [public repos](https://github.com/finzyphinzy). Go ahead, take a peek. you might just find something weird and wonderful. Or broken. Both are fun.

### 🌱 Always Learning

I get excited about:
- Solving hard problems.
- Building tools people *actually* use.
- Diving into new tech without fear (okay, *some* fear, but I still do it).
- Turning "I’ve never done this before" into “Oh, I’ve totally got this.”

### 🎉 Fun Facts

- Will refactor your code *and* your life.  
- Prefers dark mode. Even in daylight.
