🌎 A big part of everyday involves working on a project. Don't be surprised when you find out I'm constantly reading books or asking a lot of questions. 

🚧 I’m currently working on writing a compiler and interpreter with GOLANG.

📖 I'm reading "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" by Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau and Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and "Outliers" by Malcolm Gladwell.

🎏 I love linux, chess and projects. I’m open to collaborate on Projects with other developers. Currently, I volunteer an hour each day to Therapie! Helping with bootstrapping the product as well as handling users data.
