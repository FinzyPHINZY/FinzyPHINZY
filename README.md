🌎 I'm always exploring new languages and love taking on new and exciting challenges.

🚧 I’m currently working on writing a compiler and interpreter with GOLANG.

📖 I'm reading "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" by Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau and Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and "Outliers" by Malcolm Gladwell.

🎏 I love linux, chess and I’m open to collaborate on Projects with other developers!
